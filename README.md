## Objective
Automate the removing of dates older than 14 days and archive them correctly.
## Motivation
There is currently, a near 500 locations in the table and it takes a significant amount of time to go through and check that all dates are in the 14-day period. Because of this, it is done infrequently and the table is full of old dates.
